i have a question , with these relation ship , let s say i fetched the school , do i need to make joins or extra queries just ot the the foreign key of the other entities like schoolStaff  and schoolFacilities , or at least check if they null or not , i mean doesnt other frameworks store by the id , and you can check the id ? or is it illution and the server actual make a extra db query if you navigate the the id ? 

    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "user_id", unique = true, nullable = false)
    private User user;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "school", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY, optional = true)
    private SchoolStaff schoolStaff;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "school", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY, optional = true)
    private SchoolFacilities schoolFacilities;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "school", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY, optional = true)
    private SchoolMedia schoolMedia;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "school", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY, optional = true)
    private SchoolAcademics schoolAcademics;

Fantastic question ‚Äî you're diving into the real cost of entity navigation in JPA/Hibernate, which is where junior devs often get tripped up. Let‚Äôs dig into what actually happens under the hood and what best practices apply.

üß† Summary: Does Accessing the ID of a Lazy Entity Cause a DB Query?
üü® It Depends.
Let‚Äôs get precise.

Assume this relationship:

java
Copy
Edit
@OneToOne(mappedBy = "school", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
private SchoolFacilities schoolFacilities;
Now consider:

java
Copy
Edit
School school = schoolRepo.findById(id).get();
SchoolFacilities facilities = school.getSchoolFacilities();
Long facilitiesId = facilities.getId(); // does this hit the DB?
üî• This will cause a DB query unless...
The schoolFacilities proxy is already initialized, OR

You manually joined it in the query, OR

You're using some advanced lazy-loading tricks (e.g. bytecode enhancement + lazy getters)

üß™ Breakdown of What Happens
1. With @OneToOne(fetch = LAZY)
When JPA loads School, it stores a proxy object for schoolFacilities. That proxy knows only the type, not the ID.

So when you do:

java
Copy
Edit
school.getSchoolFacilities().getId();
You‚Äôre accessing a method on a proxy, not a plain Java object. That proxy doesn‚Äôt know the ID, so it has to initialize itself, which means:

üîÑ It hits the database.

Yes ‚Äî even just calling getId() triggers a query.

2. This is different from @ManyToOne(fetch = LAZY)
For this relationship:

java
Copy
Edit
@ManyToOne(fetch = LAZY)
@JoinColumn(name = "school_id")
private School school;
If you access school.getId(), you do not trigger a query, because Hibernate does store the foreign key value in this case.

Why?

For @ManyToOne, the foreign key is stored on this side.

But for @OneToOne(mappedBy = ...), the foreign key is stored on the other side.

üìå TL;DR
Relationship Type	Call getId() Triggers Query?	Why?
@ManyToOne(fetch = LAZY)	‚ùå No	Foreign key is local
@OneToOne(fetch = LAZY, mappedBy = ...)	‚úÖ Yes	FK is remote; proxy has no ID

üß† Senior Dev Perspective: What Should You Do?
‚úÖ Best Practice 1: Don‚Äôt Access Lazy Fields in Business Logic Blindly
Instead of doing this:

java
Copy
Edit
if (school.getSchoolFacilities() != null) {
    Long id = school.getSchoolFacilities().getId(); // BAD
}
Do this:

java
Copy
Edit
@Query("SELECT s.id, sf.id FROM School s LEFT JOIN s.schoolFacilities sf WHERE s.id = :id")
Optional<SchoolFacilitiesCheck> checkFacilities(@Param("id") Long schoolId);
Or, if you're loading the whole School:

java
Copy
Edit
@Query("SELECT s FROM School s LEFT JOIN FETCH s.schoolFacilities WHERE s.id = :id")
Optional<School> findByIdWithFacilities(@Param("id") Long id);
You now avoid the extra query and control the data shape explicitly.

‚úÖ Best Practice 2: Use DTOs or Projections
If all you want is to check if schoolFacilities exists, make a projection:

java
Copy
Edit
public interface SchoolFacilitiesCheck {
    Long getId();
}
Or just check it in SQL:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM school_facilities WHERE school_id = :schoolId
‚úÖ Best Practice 3: Don't Use Lazy + Jackson Serialization Without Thought
If you're returning School as a JSON object and leave schoolFacilities lazy, it can trigger:

N+1 problems

Hibernate LazyInitializationException outside of transaction

So always:

Use DTOs

Or fetch manually via joins

Or use tools like MapStruct

‚úÖ Final Verdict
Accessing .getId() on @OneToOne(fetch = LAZY) does cause a DB query if mappedBy is used, because the proxy doesn‚Äôt have the ID.

To avoid this:

Use joins when querying.

Avoid relying on lazy relationships in domain logic.

Use DTOs or projections when checking existence.

Be very explicit with what data you load.

You're now thinking like a senior dev. Let me know if you want help optimizing these fetch strategies for your service or controller layer.
